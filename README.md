Focus, your distraction-free Task Manager.

- 📗 Organize your tasks into workspaces and lists.
- 📱 Use it completely offline (it's a local-first PWA!).
- 🎨 Clean and minimalistic design to help you _focus_.
- 🔍 Search for any task, list, or workspace.
- 📅 Schedule task deadlines.
- 🔐 Keep data safe in your [Solid POD](https://solidproject.org/).
- 📝 Take notes in task scratchpads with Markdown support for rich text.

## Under the hood

If you're curious to learn how this came to be, I've been sharing updates in a video series and a development journal:

- [Rebuilding Solid Focus with Aerogel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA3GcuMVHSbzxnR45Gzu2w7QuKs247tE5).
- [Making a Web Application Framework](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/making-a-web-application-framework).

There is currently no documentation for developers, but you can get started by learning its main technologies:

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Soukai](https://soukai.js.org/)
- [Aerogel](https://aerogel.js.org/)
