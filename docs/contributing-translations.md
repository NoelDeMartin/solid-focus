# Contribute translations

If you want to contribute translations, that's awesome! You can find all the translations in the [/src/lang](../src/lang/) folder (in case you want to learn more, check out [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html)'s documentation).

But before you start, I'd like to clarify a couple of things I expect from translators.

## New languages

I believe that no translation is better than a bad translation. As a non-native English speaker, I'd much rather read something in English that's written properly than a subpar translation in my mother tongue.

So, what do I mean with this? It doesn't mean that you have to be a professional translator or anything like that. But it does mean that I expect some commitment from your part to keep the translations up-to date. I don't think I'll be changing text too often, but something will change or be added from time to time.

However, keep in mind that I won't be able to judge the quality of translations (I already translated the app in all the languages I speak). So don't take this as a warning that your translations will be rejected or criticized. But be mindful of taking ownership if you're the one starting the translation.

If after reading this you still want to add a new language, thank you :D. All you need to do is create a new file in the `src/lang/` folder (you can just copy one of the existing files), and add your language in the `src/lang/locales.json` file. If you have any issues with GitHub or don't know how to propose changes, please let me know.

If the language you want to contribute to already exists, that's another story!

## Improvements & typos

If you see a typo or something that could be phrased better, please let me know! It's the small details that matter the most :). You can propose the changes [right here on github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository) (even if you're not a developer, don't be scared, it's very easy!). Or you can simply let me know and I'll fix them myself.
