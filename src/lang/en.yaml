    title: Hello there!
    message: |
        Thanks for visiting **Focus**. The app is still a Work In Progress, so I don't recommend using it in production. But feel free
        to play around with it and take it for a spin. Most of the functionality is already in place, but there are still some things
        I want to do and I can't guarantee that it won't change in the final version.

        Also, please don't share it too widely because I think first impressions are important and I've still got some work to do :).

        You can find more about what is missing, and give some feedback, in the [Beta Feedback](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-focus/issues/15) issue.
        If you want to know when this is ready, subscribe to the issue in GitHub to get a notification.
