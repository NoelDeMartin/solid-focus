        learnMore: What is Solid?
        learnMoreMessage: |
            Solid is a decentralized storage protocol built on top of web standards. If you want to use this app across devices, you can use Solid to keep changes in sync. Even if you use it in a single device, this will also keep your data secure in case your device is lost.

            In any case, Focus works 100% offline and you can connect your Solid POD later on. If you've never heard of Solid and you're just trying things out, you can keep using it without an account.

    title: Hello there!
    message: |
        Thanks for visiting **Focus**. The app is still a Work In Progress, so I don't recommend using it in production. But feel free
        to play around with it and take it for a spin. Most of the functionality is already in place, but there are still some things
        I want to do and I can't guarantee that it won't change in the final version.

        Also, please don't share it too widely because I think first impressions are important and I've still got some work to do :).

        You can find more about what is missing, and give some feedback, in the [Beta Feedback](#) issue. If you want to know when this is ready, subscribe
        to the issue in GitHub to get a notification.
